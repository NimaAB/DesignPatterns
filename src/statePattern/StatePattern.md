The State pattern helps us to change states of an object without using any condition.
Those different states classes have a composite relation with the object that behave.
And, this relation will help the states to change the object's state, which is changing the behavior of the object 
as a result.

For example a Gate has to States: 
- closed state
- open state 

When the Gate is in close state, it can be open again, and chande it's state to open state. 
 And, the opposite way.
 
**State Pattern is a behavioral pattern.**
